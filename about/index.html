Yep, I'm a one man shop, and I'm proud of it. I don't see any reason to pretend that my company is any bigger. Besides, this means that you're always communicating with the person who will actually be doing the work. No need to worry about things getting "lost in translation" when the sales guy passes the work off to another employee. </p> <p> I've been a software developer/consultant in one form or another since 2005. If you want to stretch the definition a little, I helped some companies develop their e-commerce solutions back in 2001. <a title="Software Consultancy" href="/">Torspark llc</a> was officially created in early 2011. </p> <div class='panel callout'> <div class=row> <div class='small-12 medium-8 columns'> <h5><a href="/newsletter/">Subscribe to the Newsletter</a></h5> <p> If you like what you see, you can receive more exclusive content in the newsletter.

From the beginning of the project, he offered strategic and creative ways to meet my goals for a one page rsvp website. He offered three different ideas with three different price points, and was very quick to respond when I asked questions about each option. Once the project started, he completed the design very quickly, exceeding the timeline and finishing the project before the deadline. He went above and beyond, was professional and an absolute pleasure to work with. I highly recommend working with Chris. <cite>Mindy Klement, Director of Marketing, ARC</cite> </blockquote> <blockquote> You have consistently delivered the level of quality we aspire to deliver, and did it to a standard that often exceeded our expectations. You are a pleasure to work with, even during 'crunch time' when a deadline is looming, and the pace is frantic. <cite>Larry V., COO, Software Development Firm</cite> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class=row> <div class='small-12 columns'> <p class=text-right>Crafted by <a title="Custom Software Development &amp; Consultancy" href="/">Torspark</a></p> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/js/all.js"></script> <script src='https://squaresend.com/squaresend.js'></script> <script>
