From the beginning of the project, he offered strategic and creative ways to meet my goals for a one page rsvp website. He offered three different ideas with three different price points, and was very quick to respond when I asked questions about each option. Once the project started, he completed the design very quickly, exceeding the timeline and finishing the project before the deadline. He went above and beyond, was professional and an absolute pleasure to work with. I highly recommend working with Chris. <cite>Mindy Klement, Director of Marketing, ARC</cite> </blockquote> <blockquote> Tania is a communication genius. She evokes outside the box thinking through thoughtful and insightful questions. Her discerning thought process allows her to be thorough in clarifying and helping to define the needs of her client, while her ability to get to the heart of an issue and simplify rhetoric was a godsend when it came to refining Black Mamba Protection’s market segmentation objectives and the intentions of various communication based projects. I highly recommend Tania! <cite>Daniel Fisk, Retail Account Manager, Black Mamba Protection</cite> </blockquote> <blockquote> You have consistently delivered the level of quality we aspire to deliver, and did it to a standard that often exceeded our expectations. You are a pleasure to work with, even during 'crunch time' when a deadline is looming, and the pace is frantic. <cite>Larry V., COO, Software Development Firm</cite> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class=row> <div class='small-12 columns'> <p class=text-right>Crafted by <a title="Custom Software Development &amp; Consultancy" href="/">Torspark</a></p> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/js/all.js"></script> <script src='https://squaresend.com/squaresend.js'></script> <script>
