Is it a pain to get upper management to approve that big down payment? Or are you having trouble tracking &amp; budgeting for various hourly invoices? You&rsquo;re a good client, of course, but do you want your consultant wasting his time trying to collect fees from other less reputable clients? </p> <p>Maybe the developer you hired turned out to be a hack. Or your dev just doesn&rsquo;t seem to have enough time for you. Or they don&rsquo;t communicate with you as much as you&rsquo;d like. Whatever the reason, now you&rsquo;re wondering how you can salvage some of that hefty down payment or if you just have to try to make the most of the situation. It may seem a little scary at first, but up front weekly billing can help you avoid these situations. See the benefits below, or read about <a title="Charging weekly will make you happier" href="/advantages-of-weekly-billing-for-developers/">weekly billing from a developer&rsquo;s perspective</a>.</p> <h2>Why you should want to be charged weekly as a client</h2> <h3>Easy on your budget</h3> <p><strong>Weekly payments are easy to budget.</strong> You know exactly how much you&rsquo;ll need to pay each week. A lot of managers can even just use their discretionary fund to pay for development, rather than having to get a 50% down payment approved by upper management. If you&rsquo;re a small business, you can easily make payments with your credit card, and not worry about a large upfront payment putting your business at risk by becoming cash poor.</p> <h3>Limit your risk</h3> <p>By paying weekly, you can <strong>limit the risk</strong> of getting stuck with a bad developer. If you aren&rsquo;t satisfied with the past week&rsquo;s worth of work, you are free to stop paying and find a new developer. No need to feel like you&rsquo;re committed to a slow developer. No need to worry about how to get the most out of your down payment or even trying to recoup some of it in court. At worst, you&rsquo;re out just a week&rsquo;s worth of money, and that&rsquo;s it.</p> <h3>Know your developer is focused on your project</h3> <p>By paying your developer for a week&rsquo;s worth of work in advance, you can be secure in the knowledge that <strong>your developer is focused on your project</strong>. You don&rsquo;t really want them working on your project for a couple hours here and there among the other projects on their plate. That just slows the development down and decreases the quality, because of all the context switching they&rsquo;re going through, bouncing from project to project.</p> <p>You&rsquo;ll also get the added benefit of having a <strong>faster and more motivated developer</strong>. If you&rsquo;re paying hourly invoices, the slower your dev works, the more money they&rsquo;ll receive. Is that right? Your developer should be an expert professional. If they know you trust them to provide value, they&rsquo;ll be encouraged to work as efficiently as possible, because procrastinating won&rsquo;t make them any more money. There&rsquo;s also the push to deliver value <em>every single week</em>, because they know you could choose to just end the engagement at any time.</p> <h3>Why waste your time arguing over what&rsquo;s in scope</h3> <p>Paying weekly means you don&rsquo;t have to constantly check the original scope document to see if you can request this or that little change. Let&rsquo;s face it, that scope document is usually out of date <em>within a week</em> of signing it. You won&rsquo;t have to waste time on addendums to the original contract, because you can just as for the change, knowing that you&rsquo;ve already paid for this week&rsquo;s work.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Now, weekly billing doesn&rsquo;t sound so scary does it? If you give it a chance, I bet you&rsquo;ll even prefer it. If your developer isn&rsquo;t charging weekly, maybe you should ask them why not?
