This is where I'll ask you about your project to make sure it's a good fit before we proceed any further. </p> <h5>Trial Project</h5> <p> If your schedule allows, we'll start with a smaller related project before committing to the whole thing. The Trial Project can be anything from a landing page to a subset of features for your application. This gives us both a chance to "kick the tires" and ensure that our work styles are compatible. The Trial Project gives us a chance to build a strong foundation for our working relationship, so we can hit the ground running when we're ready to take on the <a href="#full-project">Full Project</a>. </p> <h5>Agile + Kanban + Chaos Model of Development</h5> <p> I've experimented with a variety of consulting and software development methodologies, and I've come to favor a blend of a few different styles. I like to work closely with you, the client/product owner/business person, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Software Development</a> methods, while using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a> system to manage and track our day to day progress, in which we'll use the guiding principles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_model">Chaos Model</a> to prioritize our tasks. </p> <p> That's really just a fancy way of saying that I want to work with you in an iterative and adaptive way, while ensuring the important stuff that impacts your bottom line gets done first. </p> <h5 id=full-project>Full Project</h5> <p> After the Trial Project is complete, We should have a good feel for how well we can work together on a larger scale. With this knowledge in hand, it'll be easy to talk some numbers and figure out a solid plan of attack that will lead to a significant ROI. </p> <p> All my custom work comes with a 30-day bug-free warranty. </p> <div class='panel callout'> <p> Are you interested in exploring the possibilities? <a href="mailto:2kn4ol38?sqs_title=How+can+I+help+you...">Shoot me a message</a> to set up your free consultation. </p> </div> <h3>Testimonials</h3> <blockquote> You have consistently delivered the level of quality we aspire to deliver, and did it to a standard that often exceeded our expectations.
